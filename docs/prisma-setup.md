# Prisma setup

you need to type the following command to install Prisma CLI as a development dependency:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```
Then Generate Prisma Client (though this is typically done automatically during migration):

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

# What does `prisma generate` this do?

`npx prisma generate` creates the Prisma Client based on your schema definition. Specifically, it:

1. Reads your `schema.prisma` file
2. Generates TypeScript types that match your database models (`FolderPath` and `FavoriteLocations`)
3. Creates a type-safe API for database operations

The generated client provides strongly-typed methods for each model, like:
- `db.folderPath.findMany()`
- `db.folderPath.create()`
- `db.folderPath.update()`
- `db.folderPath.delete()`

This is what enables the database operations in your `home._index.tsx` file to work with proper TypeScript support. You'll need to run this command again whenever you make changes to your Prisma schema.
