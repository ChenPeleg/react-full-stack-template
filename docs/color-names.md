# Material design color names

The material design color names have these formats:

Primary — used for the main color of the app
Secondary — used for the secondary color of the app
Tertiary - used for the tertiary color of the app
"On" (e.g. "On Primary")—used for text/icons on the primary color

Material Design 3's color system defines semantic color roles that create meaningful UI elements through consistent application. The surface colors in M3 are particularly important:

- **Surface colors** form the foundation of UI components and typically appear in the background
- The system includes various surface variants (surface, surfaceVariant, surfaceTint, etc.)
- Surface colors usually have subtle, neutral tones to support content display
- They help establish visual hierarchy through elevation and contrast

Your `surfaceMain` color (#F3F4F6) is a light gray tone that aligns with Material Design principles for main surface areas, providing a neutral background that supports content without competing for attention.
